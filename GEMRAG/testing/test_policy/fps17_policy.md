**Medicare Claims Processing Manual Chapter 15 Section 30.2.D**

> Providers must report revenue code 054X and, for services provided before January 1, 2001,
> one of the following CMS HCPCS codes for each ambulance trip provided during the billing
> period:
> 
> A0030 (discontinued 12/31/2000); A0040 (discontinued 12/31/2000);
> A0050 (discontinued 12/31/2000); A0320 (discontinued 12/31/2000); A0322 (discontinued
> 12/31/2000); A0324 (discontinued 12/31/2000); A0326 (discontinued 12/31/2000); A0328,
> (discontinued 12/31/2000); or A0330 (discontinued 12/31/2000).
> 
> In addition, providers report one of A0380 or A0390 for mileage HCPCS codes. No other
> HCPCS codes are acceptable for reporting ambulance services and mileage. Providers report
> one of the following revenue codes:
> 0540;
> 0542;
> 0543;
> 0545;
> 0546; or
> 0548.
> 
> Do not report revenue codes 0541, 0544, or 0547.
> 
> For claims with dates of service on or after January 1, 2001, providers must report revenue
> code 540 and one of the following HCPCS codes for each ambulance trip provided during the
> billing period:
> 
> A0426; A0427; A0428; A0429; A0430; A0431; A0432; A0433; or A0434.
> 
> Providers using an ALS vehicle to furnish a BLS level of service report HCPCS code, A0426
> (ALS1) or A0427 (ALS1 emergency), and are paid accordingly. In addition, all providers
> report one of the following mileage HCPCS codes: A0380; A0390; A0435; or A0436.
> 
> Since billing requirements do not allow for more than one HCPCS code to be reported for per
> revenue code line, providers must report revenue code 0540 (ambulance) on two separate and
> consecutive lines to accommodate both the Part B ambulance service and the mileage HCPCS
> codes for each ambulance trip provided during the billing period. Each loaded (e.g., a patient is
> onboard) 1-way ambulance trip must be reported with a unique pair of revenue code lines on the
> claim. Unloaded trips and mileage are NOT reported.
> 
> However, in the case where the beneficiary was pronounced dead after the ambulance is
> called/dispatched but before the ambulance arrives at the scene: Payment may be made for a
> BLS service if a ground vehicle is dispatched or at the fixed wing or rotary wing base rate, as
> applicable, if an air ambulance is dispatched. Neither mileage nor a rural adjustment would be
> paid. The blended rate amount will otherwise apply. Providers or suppliers report the A0428
> (BLS) non-emergency or A0429 (BLS) emergency transport HCPCS code if an emergency
> response and modifier QL (Patient pronounced dead after ambulance called) in “HCPCS/Rates”
> instead of the origin and destination modifier for ground vehicles. In addition to the QL
> modifier, institutional-based providers report modifier QM or QN. If the time of death
> pronouncement is after takeoff to point of pickup but before the beneficiary is loaded on-board
> the air ambulance, air ambulance providers or suppliers bill the A0430 or A0431 depending on
> the type of aircraft and modifier QL.
> 
> If the ambulance is called/dispatched but the beneficiary dies on the scene prior to the arrival of
> the ambulance: Payment may be made for BLS service if a ground vehicle is dispatched or at
> the fixed wing or rotary wing base rate, as applicable, if an air ambulance is dispatched.
> Neither mileage nor a rural adjustment would be paid. Providers or suppliers report the A0428
> (BLS) non-emergency or A0429 (BLS) emergency transport HCPCS code if an emergency
> response and modifier QL for ground vehicles. Air ambulance providers or suppliers bill the
> A0430 or A0431 depending on the type of aircraft and modifier QL, if the time of death
> pronouncement is after takeoff to point of pickup but before the beneficiary is loaded on-board
> the air ambulance.
> 
> If the beneficiary dies after the ambulance is dispatched but before the beneficiary is loaded
> onboard the ambulance (before or after arrival at the point-of-pickup): Medicare payment
> determination is provider’s or supplier’s BLS base rate, no mileage or rural adjustment; providers or
> suppliers report the A0428 (BLS) non-emergency or A0429 (BLS) emergency transport HCPCS
> code if an emergency response and modifier QL. However, if the beneficiary dies after pickup,
> prior to or upon arrival at the receiving facility: Medically necessary level of service furnished
> will be the payment determination.
