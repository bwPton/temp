THIS PROVIDES A MEANS OF REPORTING REDUCED SERVICES WITHOUT DISTURBING THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE BASIC SERVICE. MODIFIER CODE 09952 MAY BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO MODIFIER -52. NOTE: FOR HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT REPORTING OF A PREVIOUSLY SCHEDULED PROCEDURE/SERVICE THAT IS PARTIALLY REDUCED OR CANCELLED AS A RESULT OF EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES OR THOSE THAT THREATEN THE WELL-BEING OF THE PATIENT PRIOR TO OR AFTER ADMINISTRATION OF ANESTHESIA, SEE MODIFIERS -73 AND -74 (SEE MODIFIERS APPROVED FOR ASC HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT USE)."

59,"DISTINCT PROCEDURAL SERVICE: UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE PHYSICIAN MAY NEED TO INDICATE THAT A PROCEDURE OR SERVICE WAS DISTINCT OR INDEPENDENT FROM OTHER SERVICES PERFORMED ON THE SAME DAY. MODIFIER -59 IS USED TO IDENTIFY PROCEDURES/SERVICES THAT ARE NOT NORMALLY REPORTED TOGETHER, BUT ARE APPROPRIATE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THIS MAY REPRESENT A DIFFERENT SESSION OR PATIENT ENCOUNTER, DIFFERENT PROCEDURE OR SURGERY, DIFFERNET SITE OR ORGAN SYSTEM, SEPARATE INCISION/EXCISION, SEPARATE LESION, OR SEPARATE INJURY (OR AREA OF INJURY IN EXTENSIVE INJURIES) NOT ORDINARILY ENCOUNTERED OR PERFORMED ON THE SAME DAY BY THE SAME PHYSICIAN. HOWEVER, WHAN ANOTHER ALREADY ESTABLISHED MODIFIER IS APPROPRIATE IT SHOULD BE USED RATHER THAN MODIFIER -59. ONLY IF NO MORE DESCRIPTIVE MODIFIER IS AVAILABLE, AND THE USE OF MODIFIER -59 BEST EXPLAINS THE CIRCUMSTANCES, SHOULD MODIFIER -59 BE USED. MODIFIER CODE 09959 MAY BE USED AS AN ALTERNATE TO MODIFIER -59."

IF ADDITIONAL PROCEDURE(S) (INCLUDING ADD-ON PROCEDURE(S)) ARE PERFORMED DURING THE SAME SURGICAL SESSION, SEPARATE CODE(S) MAY BE REPORTED WITHOUT THE MODIFIER -62 ADDED. MODIFIER CODE 09962 MAY BE USED AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO MODIFIER -62. NOTE: IF A CO-SURGEON ACTS AS AN ASSISTANT IN THE PERFORMANCE OF ADDITIONAL PROCEDURE(S) DURING THE SAME SURGICAL SESSION, THOSE SERVICES MAY BE REPORTED USING SEPARATE PROCEDURE CODE(S) WITH THE MODIFIER -80 OR MODIFIER -81 ADDED, AS APPROPRIATE."
